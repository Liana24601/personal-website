        <h2>Review: *And Then There Were None*</h2>
        <p>
          If my eigth grade civics teacher had never let me borrow this book, I would have never experienced one of the best murder mystery books of all time. "And Then There Were None" is an amazing book. Though Agatha Christie has written many great classics with fascinating characters and crazy plot twists, this one is my absolute favorite. The characters were really relatable and charismatic and interesting (Vera and Phillip were my favorites) and the plot was jaw dropping. The twist in the end had me running in circles. Reading the reveal in science class is a memory I will not forget, especially because it affected me days afterward. I definitely recommend this book to mystery lovers, as it is Agatha Christie creating a compelling story and doing what she does best. If you'd like to check out more Agatha Christie books, "Death on The Nile" is very near to my heart, and "Murder on the Orient Express" was pretty good as well.

        <h2>Thoughts on *Yellowface*</h2>
        <p>
          THIS BOOK IS PEAK OMG!!! Arguably best book I've read this year. It's about June, a struggling writer who takes a crazy risk to shoot to literary fame. I don't want to spoil more of the plot, but the book is absolutely wild. It really opened my eyes to a lot of things, like how brutal it is in the publishing industry and the discrimination faced by Asians. June's half jealousy, half adimiration of Athena is so relatable. June's need to rely on social media and praise is validation is a sad but bitter truth. One reasons I loved the book is because it was only at the end that I realized that June is truly a bad person, despite the book being told in her perspective. I loved the book so much, and it truly deserved the hype.

        <h2>Review: *The Hearts We Sold*</h2>
        <p>
          Honestly, I did not expect this one to cook as much as it did. I was just wanting a sweet and simple young adult novel to vibe to, after reading a bunch of other books with heavy themes and lots of tears. I was hooked by the first chapter. The worldbuilding went crazy, it felt so authentic and real. Dee was charming as a main charcter (although a bit annoying at times), and I truly love the way her story was told. Reading the plot twist at the end was like ripping my heart out. I love books like these ("The Measure", for example) because they take a crazy "What If?" scenario and create not only a crazy plot, but a world that feels almost real. They show how people's reactions and ways of life are changed by these circumstances, and do it in such a way that you forget you're reading a book for a second. For its crazy plot twists and sad story stuff (to be honest, I did cry a little), the "The Hearts We Sold" is a wondeful book that should be next on your list for sure.

        <h2>Thoughts on *If We Were Villains*</h2>
        <p>
          Loved the dark academia vibes of this book. "If We Were Villains" is about Oliver, who is released from jail and finally tells the dark history behind the crime that put him in jail. Wrapped in drama, theater, and Shakespeare, this book was truly a treat to read. I fell in love with all of the characters. Oliver, Meredith, Phillipa, Wren, Alexander, James, and Richard, even though he's a jerk. They all felt so real to me, with flaws and fears and hopes and dreams. They were a little overdramatic, of course, being actors, but they were humans. And the drama was so mad enticiing. Definitely a prime book for someone who loves murder mysteries (me), someone who loves drama (me), and someone who loves theater (also me). The book had an aesthetic vibe like a cross between Harry Potter and Dead Poets Society. And the writing is just beautiful. It truly feels like it was written by someone who worships Shakespeare so much that it kills them. The book hit me so hard I made a literal Pinterest board for it. 10/10, no notes.

        <h2>Review: *Little Thieves*</h2>
        <p>
          "Little thieves steal gold, and great ones steal kingdoms, but only one goes to the gallows." is a fire quote, and its from this book. That saying stayed with me forever, years after I closed the book. I remember reading the prologue and being hooked at once. It felt like one of those dark, vivid fairytales that you hear from a friend and remember for the rest of your life. This book is truly enchanting, and the plot was a wild ride start to finish. Vanja was everything I could want in a main character. She is cunning, crafty, intelligent, and a bit snarky. Kind of like Emma Stone in Disney's Cruella. I loved Vanja's character developement. I loved the way she went from only thinking about herself and getting rich to caring for those around her and realizing that there's more to life than gold. I was also glad to see her heal from the suffering she went through in the past, and her relationship with Gisele. The world building and magic of it all so well done too. The finale where all the Gods showed up for the trial was breathtaking. The slow burn on the side was pretty fun too. I haven't read the sequel yet, because I don't want to risk ruining the impression of the orginal, which was just so perfect. Beautiful book for fantasy lovers. (Also the cover art has so much aura ngl)

        <h2>Review: *The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo*</h2>
        <p>
          I, like so many others I know, judged this book so fast by its title at the first glance. I thought it would be some plotless multi-tiered romance book that has little thought, basic writing, and is essentially just a large waste of time. But "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo" was just the opposite. With compelling storytelling and gorgeously written characters (Harry was my favorite), this book felt so real to me, like a part-documentary, part 90s hollywood movie about the confessions of cinema's greatest star. Evelyn Hugo's story is truly captivating, and she manages to surprise you in more ways than one. The (multiple) plot twists during the story were beautiful, as were the many relations betweem characters. This was definitely a page turner, as I read it all in one go at an airport in Amsterdam. Evelyn is a famous silver screen Hollywood Star (think Marilyn Monroe) with her fair share of drama, scandals, rumors, and of course, husbands. When average journalist Monique is called on to publish a tell-all book about Evelyn's journey, all her many secrets and struggles will be unraveled for all to see. Evelyn's journey was masterfully presented to the reader, as she struggles to rise to fame, avoid numerous scandals that would scar her reputation, and hide her darkest and most dangerous secret from the world who watches her so closely, on the screen and off it. "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo" is a must-read for anyone who enjoys drama, and I ensure you, the ending will have you in tears.

        <h2>Thoughts on *The Book Thief*</h2>
        <p>
          Let me tell you right now, this book is SO TOUGH OMG. Usually, I'm not really one for historical fictions (especially ones about the world wars, it's just not my thing), but this book is literally one of the most beautiful things I've ever read. It's a beautifully crafted narrative about life, death, circumstance, and the power of words. But the thing that makes the book so unique (my favorite thing about it, by the way) is that the story is narrated by Death. I don't think this book would have hit as hard it did if he was not the narrator. Not to hate on Liesel or Rudy or Max, but he was definitely my favorite character. Death's profound quotes and quirky way of storytelling (some many spoilers, omg) made it enjoyable and also made me sob at times. I also appreciate the depth used when the author was writing him. 10/10 character, no notes. Descriptions and writing ate, and made evrything feel real. To Death's odd story habits to the funky little people in Liesel's small town. The copy I own has an afterword section with the author's notes and planning, and it was really cool to see how the book started in its early stages and evolved into what it was today. Seeing Liesel's character arc grow into what she is wonderful. The most intrugieng theme of the book was how do small, insignificant people (like Liesel and Max) survive in a world so terrible, one so awful and evil that even Death himself can stand humans at times. How do they live, knowing that they are nothing but cogs in the machine, prisoners in a system beyond their control? When words of hate are flung so violently and often, when they are drilled into people's heads so much they forget to think for themselves, is it possible to use words for something other than destruction. These were all questions the book asked and answered in the most poetic and meaningful way, which is why I cry a little inside every time I think of it. A truly wonderful novel that is worth a couple of re-reads and a place on your bookshelf.
