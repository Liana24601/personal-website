        <h2>Review: *And Then There Were None*</h2>
        <p>
          If my eigth grade civics teacher had never let me borrow this book, I would have never experienced one of the best murder mystery books of all time. "And Then There Were None" is an amazing book. Though Agatha Christie has written many great classics with fascinating characters and crazy plot twists, this one is my absolute favorite. The characters were really relatable and charismatic and interesting (Vera and Phillip were my favorites) and the plot was jaw dropping. The twist in the end had me running in circles. Reading the reveal in science class is a memory I will not forget, especially because it affected me days afterward. I definitely recommend this book to mystery lovers, as it is Agatha Christie creating a compelling story and doing what she does best. If you'd like to check out more Agatha Christie books, "Death on The Nile" is very near to my heart, and "Murder on the Orient Express" was pretty good as well.

        <h2>Thoughts on *Yellowface*</h2>
        <p>
          THIS BOOK IS PEAK OMG!!! Arguably best book I've read this year. It's about June, a struggling writer who takes a crazy risk to shoot to literary fame. I don't want to spoil more of the plot, but the book is absolutely wild. It really opened my eyes to a lot of things, like how brutal it is in the publishing industry and the discrimination faced by Asians. June's half jealousy, half adimiration of Athena is so relatable. June's need to rely on social media and praise is validation is a sad but bitter truth. One reasons I loved the book is because it was only at the end that I realized that June is truly a bad person, despite the book being told in her perspective. I loved the book so much, and it truly deserved the hype.

        <h2>Review: *The Hearts We Sold*</h2>
        <p>
          Honestly, I did not expect this one to cook as much as it did. I was just wanting a sweet and simple young adult novel to vibe to, after reading a bunch of other books with heavy themes and lots of tears. I was hooked by the first chapter. The worldbuilding went crazy, it felt so authentic and real. Dee was charming as a main charcter (although a bit annoying at times), and I truly love the way her story was told. Reading the plot twist at the end was like ripping my heart out. I love books like these ("The Measure", for example) because they take a crazy "What If?" scenario and create not only a crazy plot, but a world that feels almost real. They show how people's reactions and ways of life are changed by these circumstances, and do it in such a way that you forget you're reading a book for a second. For its crazy plot twists and sad story stuff (to be honest, I did cry a little), the "The Hearts We Sold" is a wondeful book that should be next on your list for sure.

        <h2>Thoughts on *If We Were Villains*</h2>
        <p>
          Loved the dark academia vibes of this book. "If We Were Villains" is about Oliver, who is released from jail and finally tells the dark history behind the crime that put him in jail. Wrapped in drama, theater, and Shakespeare, this book was truly a treat to read. I fell in love with all of the characters. Oliver, Meredith, Phillipa, Wren, Alexander, James, and Richard, even though he's a jerk. They all felt so real to me, with flaws and fears and hopes and dreams. They were a little overdramatic, of course, being actors, but they were humans. And the drama was so mad enticiing. Definitely a prime book for someone who loves murder mysteries (me), someone who loves drama (me), and someone who loves theater (also me). The book had an aesthetic vibe like a cross between Harry Potter and Dead Poets Society. And the writing is just beautiful. It truly feels like it was written by someone who worships Shakespeare so much that it kills them. The book hit me so hard I made a literal Pinterest board for it. 10/10, no notes.

        <h2>Review: *Little Thieves*</h2>
        <p>
          "Little thieves steal gold, and great ones steal kingdoms, but only one goes to the gallows." is a fire quote, and its from this book. That saying stayed with me forever, years after I closed the book. I remember reading the prologue and being hooked at once. It felt like one of those dark, vivid fairytales that you hear from a friend and remember for the rest of your life. This book is truly enchanting, and the plot was a wild ride start to finish. Vanja was everything I could want in a main character. She is cunning, crafty, intelligent, and a bit snarky. Kind of like Emma Stone in Disney's Cruella. I loved Vanja's character developement. I loved the way she went from only thinking about herself and getting rich to caring for those around her and realizing that there's more to life than gold. I was also glad to see her heal from the suffering she went through in the past, and her relationship with Gisele. The world building and magic of it all so well done too. The finale where all the Gods showed up for the trial was breathtaking. The slow burn on the side was pretty fun too. I haven't read the sequel yet, because I don't want to risk ruining the impression of the orginal, which was just so perfect. Beautiful book for fantasy lovers. (Also the cover art has so much aura ngl)

        <h2>Review: *The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo*</h2>
        <p>
          I, like so many others I know, judged this book so fast by its title at the first glance. I thought it would be some plotless multi-tiered romance book that has little thought, basic writing, and is essentially just a large waste of time. But "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo" was just the opposite. With compelling storytelling and gorgeously written characters (Harry was my favorite), this book felt so real to me, like a part-documentary, part 90s hollywood movie about the confessions of cinema's greatest star. Evelyn Hugo's story is truly captivating, and she manages to surprise you in more ways than one. The (multiple) plot twists during the story were beautiful, as were the many relations betweem characters. This was definitely a page turner, as I read it all in one go at an airport in Amsterdam. Evelyn is a famous silver screen Hollywood Star (think Marilyn Monroe) with her fair share of drama, scandals, rumors, and of course, husbands. When average journalist Monique is called on to publish a tell-all book about Evelyn's journey, all her many secrets and struggles will be unraveled for all to see. Evelyn's journey was masterfully presented to the reader, as she struggles to rise to fame, avoid numerous scandals that would scar her reputation, and hide her darkest and most dangerous secret from the world who watches her so closely, on the screen and off it. "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo" is a must-read for anyone who enjoys drama, and I ensure you, the ending will have you in tears.

        <h2>Thoughts on *The Book Thief*</h2>
        <p>
          Let me tell you right now, this book is SO TOUGH OMG. Usually, I'm not really one for historical fictions (especially ones about the world wars, it's just not my thing), but this book is literally one of the most beautiful things I've ever read. It's a beautifully crafted narrative about life, death, circumstance, and the power of words. But the thing that makes the book so unique (my favorite thing about it, by the way) is that the story is narrated by Death. I don't think this book would have hit as hard it did if he was not the narrator. Not to hate on Liesel or Rudy or Max, but he was definitely my favorite character. Death's profound quotes and quirky way of storytelling (some many spoilers, omg) made it enjoyable and also made me sob at times. I also appreciate the depth used when the author was writing him. 10/10 character, no notes. Descriptions and writing ate, and made evrything feel real. To Death's odd story habits to the funky little people in Liesel's small town. The copy I own has an afterword section with the author's notes and planning, and it was really cool to see how the book started in its early stages and evolved into what it was today. Seeing Liesel's character arc grow into what she is wonderful. The most intrugieng theme of the book was how do small, insignificant people (like Liesel and Max) survive in a world so terrible, one so awful and evil that even Death himself can stand humans at times. How do they live, knowing that they are nothing but cogs in the machine, prisoners in a system beyond their control? When words of hate are flung so violently and often, when they are drilled into people's heads so much they forget to think for themselves, is it possible to use words for something other than destruction. These were all questions the book asked and answered in the most poetic and meaningful way, which is why I cry a little inside every time I think of it. A truly wonderful novel that is worth a couple of re-reads and a place on your bookshelf.

        <h2>Review: *Long Live the Pumpkin Queen*</h2>
        <p>
          When my friend got me this book for my brithday, I was hesitant to read it at first. "The Nightmare Before Christmas" is one of my all time favorites. I love all Tim Burton works ("Corpse Bride", "Alice in Wonderland", etc), but "The Nightmare Before Christmas" is one that is close to heart. As such, I didn't want to ruin it by reading a sequel that didn't feel right. But this book was so peak. Everything from the plot to the vibes to Sally's internal monologue was just perfect. The book itself starts on Sally and Jack's wedding, and every detail was done to perfection. In my opinion, "Long Live the Pumpkin Queen" did perfection as a sequel to my favorite movie. It also did a perfect job on Sally's character arc and developement. Sally's fear of being "Queen", or being in the spotlight was so true, and felt real to her character. The book's beautiful story of Sally saving the town (and Jack lol) and overcoming that anxiety was masterfully done. The only thing that bugged me was the ending was tied up so cleanly. But since that's a minor point, I didn't care very much. As a TNBC fan, this book is top tier and sits proudly on my book shelf. Also, I like the idea of adding notable quotes in these reviews. So my chosen banger of a quote from this book would be "Because there is nothing quite so wasted as a life unlived. And I intend to live mine."

        <h2>Thoughts on *Flowers for Algernon*</h2>
        <p>
          Oh. My. God. I haven't read such a crazy story like this since the time I finished 1984. If you want a short story that is a combination of deep, heartwrenching, and excruciatingly well written, "Flowers for Algernon" is great. I first stumbled upon it in the middle of the night while scrolling. It was a sad TikTok which held a quote from the short story, combined with the chorus of Lucy Dacus' "Night Shift". That small tidbit intrigued me, so i decided to venture into this new and explored literary work. That's how I finished the short story at 4 a.m., on the verge of tears. Oh my god, it was crazy. What I loved about the book was that the raw emotions were portrayed so brilliantly. I could never go through what Charlie went through, from being saved and seeing the beauty of the world, to being tossed back into the dark again. That feeling of being on top of the world, the peak of the mountain, than come crashing back down again, and all the while being helplessly aware of it. It's such an unimaginable experience, and yet, I felt for his pain. I crumbled when his mind started slipping away. I too, loved and Algernon. Beautiful and thought compelling and tragic short story, and I recommend it if you like sobbing your eyes out and feeling numb inside. Cool quote from that story (i am in spain without the "s"): "Please if you get a chanse put some flowrs on Algernons grave in the bak yard."

        <h2>Review: *1984*</h2>
        <p>
          ASDFGHJKL I LOVE THIS BOOK OMG. Usually classic books are overhyped. Whenever I read a school required book 9/10 times it's not even that good or well-written, they're made a standard reading requirement by the schoolboard out of tradition. BUT 1984 COOKED AND DESERVED TO BE A TIMELESS CLASSIC QWERTYUIOP. Though it dragged at some parts, it's truly a masterpiece in the age of dystopian literature, as well as a commentary on society and politics. When reading the book, a lot of the actions made by the oppressive government mirrored events that happened in our own world. It's kinda scary how accurate this book was in predicting the future, from incessant and overpowering propaganda techniques to the age of constant digital surveilance which is frighteningly close to today's world. I loved that it was not only a display of terrifying dystopia, but also a commentary on how a man will truly abandon his closest principles to save himself. The idea that humans are inherently selfish, no matter how much one wishes to deny it. Very debbie downer book, but oh my god it was crazy. The ending went wild as well. Def recommend for dystopia lovers and anyone who wants to see whether a good classic is worth a read.

        <h2>Thoughts on *She Drives Me Crazy*</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone has a comfort romance movie, whether it's "The Notebook" or "The Titanic". Well, this book is like my comfort romance book. When I've bad day or I'm in a reading slump, reading this book does wonders. I just love the story so much. Scottie's journey out of recovering from a toxic relationship to loving herself as a whole was so amazing to watch. Plus, Irene and Scottie's chemistry was UNMATCHED. I loved their witty banter and the slow descent into loving each other. The fake dating trope was cute too. I also like the fact that Irene was Indian, as I am Indian too. It's a not a big deal I know, but it allowed me to relate to her more, and it was a tiny comfort to hear someone else talka bout places like Kerala and cultural pressures from your loved ones. For now, this one is definitely my top WLW book!! Def give it a read!!

        <h2>Review: *The Night Circus*</h2>
        <p>
          When I first read "The circus arrives without warning", I knew I was done for. This book had me addicted from the very first line. The emotional roller coaster that this story took me on was totally worth it. The whole story is about this weird wizard rivalry thing that's been happening for hundreds of years. Two people with insane magical powers choose a magic prodigy, train them, and make them stand against each other until one falls. It happens the same way it does many years, but this year, it's in one of the most intriguing circuses I've ever read about. I LOVE THE NIGHT CIRCUS SO MUCH. I loved its overly descriptive-ness (other people hated that but i loved it). It made it feel poetic and comforting. Like those dreams feel too real to be something your head made up. The love story aspect was also so peak: I loved Celia and Marco together. The chemistry was amazing and i loved how they both found comfort in each other, despite the circumstances. Also, it felt like real people. loved the characters. Celia, Marco, the kids, Bailey, Chandresh, literally all of them. Alexander was my fav. In my head I imagined him looking and talking like Lemony Snicket from the show "A Series of Unfortunate Events". Im begging you to read it rn omg. THE ENDING?? I LOVED THE WAY IT ENDED. everything from bailey's involvement to Alexander's conversation at the end. It was such a satysfying ending to such a beautiful story.

        <h2>Thoughts on *Sonic Prime*</h2>
        <p>
          I don't do shows very often, but this show was SO GOOD so I had to. Not a lot of people like this show, but I absolutely adored it. I've loved Sonic the Hedgehog ever since I watched the first Sonic movie in 2020. He's just a silly little guy who runs fast and fights a balding mad scientist man on the daily, which I find hilarious. However, when Sonic 3 showed us Shadow for the first time, I was utterly obsessed with whole franchise. Sonic Prime was one of the first things I watched after seeing Sonic 3, as I was yearning to see more Sonic's world and his dynamic with Shadow. And omg, this show was so peak. It's basically "Across the Spiderverse" but Sonic's version. he breaks the his world and creates a multiverse that he has to put back together again. I really loved the storytelling of the whole show, and its charcterization of characters souch as Sonic, Rouge, Nine, and Shadow. Though people argue that Sonic is characterized as childish and goofy in Sonic Prime, I adored it. To me, Sonic, whether it's the movies, the games, the shows, will always be a chili dog loving guy who makes stupid jokes when his life is in danger and will strive to save everyone no matter what. I personally believe Sonic Prime really stuck to these principles, and I loved watching Sonic in this. I also liked seeing a version of Shadow is who not a villain rather, but this one-man show who wants to fix things his own way. Seeing Sonic face his struggles and overcome all these hardships was brilliant, and I loved the way they portrayed the relationship between Shadow and Sonic. Additionally, a character who I was positively surprised by was Nine. It was refreshing to see Tails (or rather, a version of Tails) who had character depth outside of beign Sonic's bubbly and tech-smart sidekick. The way Nine was written as a character and his eventual downfall was beautiful, akin to Jinx from Arcane's story. And don't get me started on the portrayal of background characters such as Thorn Rose, Rusty Rose, Dread, and Rebel Rouge omggg. Despite being a measly kids show, the conflicts and personalities of these characters were shown really nicely, and I grew to love and adore all them. Tbh, this kids show humor gets tiring at times (that stupid Eggman baby lol), but I truly think it's still an A grade piece of media despite that. Not a lot of people enjoy Sonic Prime, but it plunged me into my Sonic Obsession and I love it, but I think it truly deserves a place on this website, and on everyone's watch list.
